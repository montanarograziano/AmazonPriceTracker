# AmazonPriceTracker

A tool written in Python used for finding the best deals on Amazon of a certain item.
Once the item to research has been inserted, the tool automatically finds the best deal navigating through the first 4 pages of research.
Once it's done analyzing, the tool automatically open on the browser the first 5 links of the products that have the biggest sale, based on the previous price and the current one.

READ THIS BEFORE USING IT:
Since the tool does certain controls on the name of the item to research, you have to input it in a correct way:
for example, if you search for "iphone11" it will find 0 matching names, since the word "iphone11" is not in the name of any product.
Instead, you have to search for "iphone 11", with the space in between.
Another example is, when finding for Tvs, search for "Tv 55'' ", not for "Tv 55 inches", since there are no products with "inches" in the name (from what i've found).
